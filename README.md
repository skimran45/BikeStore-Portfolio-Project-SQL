## Findings and Conclusion

- **Order Distribution:** The queries focus on multiple departments including sales, production, and customers, indicating a broad analysis across staffing, product pricing, and customer demographics.
- **Common Insight:** Order quantities, total sales amounts, and top customers suggest performance ranking across entities (products, customers, staff).
- **Geographical Insights:** Customer distribution by state, identifying which state has the most customers. Sales by store location, revealing performance differences based on geography.
- **Customer Categorization:** Categorizing customers based on specific keywords supports a full-funnel view to customer behavior.

This analysis provides a well-rounded view of store operations, product pricing, and customer behaviorâ€”enabling data-driven decisions across staffing, sales, and regional strategies.
